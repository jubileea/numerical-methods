HW 3 Problem 2: hw3probl2.m
Objective: Compute approximations to the derivative, f'(x0) for
 specified h  for j from 0 to 10  for D, Dhat, and Dtilde, as well as
 their respective errors e, ehat, and etilde

 Then plot in Matlab logbase10 (of the respective errors) functions versus log(h) in
different colors on the same graph, write text on the graph indicating what
color for what curve

 Also show on the graph roughly where the catastrophic-subtraction (Cat.
Sub.) errors dominate



HW 3 Problem 3: hw3p3.m
Objective: Compute approximations to the derivative, f'(x0) for specified h  for j from 0 to 8  for D, as well as
 its respective error e

 Then plot in Matlab logbase10(e) functions versus log(h) in
different colors on the same graph, write text on the graph indicating what
color for what curve

 Also show on the graph roughly where the catastrophic subtraction (Cat.
Sub.) errors dominate and where Taylor polynomial derived error dominates.


HW 3 Problem 4: hw34.m
 Objective: Compute approximations to the derivative, f''(x0) for
 specified h  for j from 0 to 5  for D, as well as
 its respective error e

 Then plot in Matlab logbase10(e2) functions versus log(h) in
different colors on the same graph, write text on the graph indicating what
color for what curve

 Also show on the graph roughly where the catastrophic subtraction (Cat.
Sub.) errors dominate and where Taylor polynomial derived error dominates
